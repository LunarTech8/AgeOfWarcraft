// Programming:

!!!>- Enter building from peasant on lumber mill doesn't work and throws undetected ability id

!!- Create a NatureSystem that controlls plant and animal growth and reproduction
!!- Building buff graphics isn't visible (buff is added correctly)
!!- Find solution for Array2D to avoid generating that many code for the array -> Classes only allow sized arrays as members
!- Maybe for UnitDynamicIndexMap instances with few entires make a version where not the unit index is used directly but a linked custom index related to system to save memory
!- Get normal unit tests to work -> Maybe reinstall wurst or write to Frotty
!- Implement information display of destructables in ObjectInfoSystem or remove if not used/needed
!- Add a description comment (/** */) to every public class and function
!- Try to improve smart order reaction when harvesting (no overwriting by auto harvest)
!- Create a WeatherSystem
!- Maybe use the PreloadIO package to store/load generated maps into/from a file
!- Maybe take account of building size diameter when calculating max ranges (MAX_AUTO_ORDER_RANGE, MAX_NEAR_BY_RANGE)
!- Maybe have repeating order actions to have less object destruction
!- Add unit tests to all bigger / more complexe systems

INFO: After new Wc3 patch delete blizzard.j and common.j in _build folder for compatibility


// -------------
// Game design:
// -------------

!!>- Work out a prototype with basic game mechanics on the StartMap -> Finish all major and critical tasks
!!>- Add settlements and homes and workplaces for people
	>>- Create a WorkshopSystem that allows buildings to process different educts into products
		- Add smart order functionality
	>>- Create a PersonSystem that stores and manages all stats of a person like food, sleep, house, workplace, etc.

!!- Reorder ability positions (e.g. for peasant)
!- Main mechanics:
	- Population management:
		- Population growths on a percentage basis.
		- Increased percentage by high happiness, food, commodities, etc.
		- Reduction by war, famine, sicknesses, etc.
		- Worker placement: Production vs. military vs. trader/logistics vs. explorer vs. science vs. aristocracy etc.
		- Worker classes: How many in lower, middle, higher classes.
	- Settlement management:
		- Each settlement only has a limited amount of resources it can work (settlement range).
		- Lots of settlements required to get all/more resources.
		- Bigger settlements required for higher classes that allow for higher tier tech and wares.
		- Bigger settlements are more defendable than smaller ones.
		- Settlement gowth vs. settlement expansion: Which settlements to grow and in which specialization, in which direction to expande and how fast.
	- Resource management:
		- Resource exchange between settlements and military camps/outposts.
		- Backpack carrier vs. wheelbarrow vs. carrier mule vs. chariot vs. ships (of different sizes and speeds) etc.
		- Bigger settlements require more types and amount of resources that they can't all produce by their own.
		- Bigger settlements require more logistic workers per settlement, bigger empires require more logistic workers because of longer routes.
	- Military management:
		- Soldiers are grouped in companies with a base camp or barracks for each that has to be supplied with food, ammunition, etc.
		- Area control: Where to station how many companies.
!- Refine prototype with generated elements on TemperateMap
!- Add more ware types and resources
!- Think about renaming ware to something different (item, good, commodity, article, product, ...)
!- Maybe add a Conventions.text like in C# projects
!- Maybe add a top header entry with name of the selected object to ObjectInfoSystem
!- Maybe show different info for ObjectInfoSystem if multiple units are selected


// -------------
// Resources:
// -------------

!!- Add all trees
!!- Add rocks, berry bushes, grass and domestic animals
!!- Add houses, storehouse, resource huts and farm
!- Add all base human units
!- Add walls and fortifications
